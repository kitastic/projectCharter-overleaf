This is the "What" of the project and it states what will be done in the project to achieve its higher purpose (the higher purpose being the vision discussed above). This section should focus mostly on what your solution is going to be and what it is going to do (i.e., we are going to build an app, robot, device, etc. to perform some task which realizes the vision).
